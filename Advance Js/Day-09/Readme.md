## what is to-do list

The lists we typically use to keep track of our daily choresâ€”or a list of everything we need to doâ€”have the most crucial things at the top and the least crucial tasks at the bottom. 
We can use it to plan our everyday schedules. We are always free to add new assignments and remove ones that have been completed. 

A TODO list can be used to complete the following four main tasks:

- Add tasks
- Update tasks
- Read tasks
- Delete tasks
